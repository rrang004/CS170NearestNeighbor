<b> Feature Selection using Nearest Neighbor </b>

This program runs the nearest neighbor algorithm on text file data sets by using forward elimination, backwards elimination, and a custom algorithm.

The idea behind the custom algorithm was to stop calculating accuracies if we reach a certain number of misses in order to minimize program runtime.
